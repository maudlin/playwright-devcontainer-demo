# Playwright-assisted manual testing — go faster without losing rigor

## What you get (from a single run)
- A headed, faithful recording of your flow that you can watch, tweak, and rerun.
- A living E2E test (Playwright) that developers can run in CI on every commit.
- A clean manual-steps CSV (and a “polished” variant) you can drop into TestRail/Xray/Sheets.
- A manual test case table (Action ↔ Expected) auto-generated from those steps.

## Why it’s faster for you
- Record once - publish twice. One walkthrough produces both automation and a manual script—no retyping selectors or steps.
- Assertions auto-pair with actions. “Verify …” lines match the previous action, giving you an instant Expected Result column.
- Readable locators, less flakiness. Recorder prefers getByRole/labels that align with UI copy and survive CSS churn.
- Versioned test assets. Steps live in git next to product code: diffable, reviewable, traceable to requirements.
- Fewer back-and-forths. Failures come with time-travel snapshots and traces—less “can you repro?” ping-pong.

## The 6-minute workflow
1. Record (headed Chromium). Click through the flow as you normally would.
2. Name the moments. Add test.step('Human sentence', …) around key actions so your CSV reads like a proper test script.
3. Run & watch. Re-run headed to validate the path and the checks.
4. Export CSV. One command emits a manual-steps CSV; optionally run the AI pass for nicer phrasing.
5. Generate cases. The converter turns steps into a tester-friendly table: Test Step + Expected Result (+ Status for execution).
6. File it. Import the CSV into your tracker or keep it in the repo for lightweight execution.

## Where it shines (concrete use cases)
- Smoke/regression packs: Record once, PR into the suite, and you’ve got both automated guards and printable checklists.
- UI copy changes: Update one test.step sentence; your automation and manual script stay in sync.
- Bug reports with evidence: Re-run the failing spec, attach the trace/snapshots plus the CSV steps—devs see exactly what you did.

## Pro tips for high-quality artefacts
- Write the narrative in test.step. That text becomes your manual steps verbatim.
- Assert the user-visible outcome. Prefer toHaveText, toBeVisible, toHaveURL—they map cleanly to Expected Result.
- Stabilise test data. Seed or use a dedicated account so manual and automated runs see the same state.
- Tag for traceability. Use test.describe titles or annotations to carry requirement IDs into exports.
- Chromium-only for speed. Record in Chromium; add Firefox/WebKit later in CI if cross-engine coverage matters.

## What stays manual (and valuable)
Exploratory testing, edge-case probing, and usability judgement don’t get “automated away.” This setup removes the transcription and duplication between your walkthrough, your written script, and the regression suite—so you spend more time testing and less time typing.

## Optional tailoring
I can tune the CSV/case generator to match your team’s columns (e.g., Component, Priority, Preconditions, Data) and set default Prerequisites (e.g., “User logged in,” “Feature flag X on”) so it drops straight into your workflow.
